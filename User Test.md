# Responses/feedbacks from users
User1
- Background: He barely has experience using chatbot and only used Amazon Alexa before. It was annoying that he had to say “Alexa,” every time he needed to talk to the chatbot.

  - [x] Replace the input box (dev:Linne)

- During an answering question via *Hello Plant*, there was a short pause moment that he was thinking about his next sentence to answer, but the chatbot assumed he finished his reply. Then, the chatbot started to respond to his answer. It didn’t let him finish his response.
- Just random questions? Sounds like no goal. Maybe pick one specific company and set questions for that company?
  
  - [ ] the bot should be able to provide company-focused questions
  - [ ] the bot should be able to provide suggestions to help him shaping the answers

- Not sure with a score system: what is this score for? maybe not score, feedbacks or suggestions? Score makes him more despondent. If a user get lower percentage, the chatbot suggests to practice the same question again?
  
  - [x] If the score is too low, the bot would ask the user to practice it again (dev:linne)
  

- A lot of times, fear of interviewing comes from the environment, not just the questions.



User2
- Background: Her previous chatbot experience is also Amazon Alexa.
- *Hello Plant* reminds her Amazon Alexa.
- Interface of the chatbot is not convincing enough.
- At the starting point, there is no clue or it is too broad what to say or where to start.

  - [x] "convincing"— having visual / audio instructions to tell you what to do

- A gray microphone is so confused. Don’t know it is recording or not.

  - [x] the visuals of microphone should be presented different stages (listening - red, "listened", gray, ... 
    - Belongs to General Layout
  
- If the interface goes smoothly, it will be helpful for her to improve her interview skills.

  - [x] the bot would ask users to 1) Do you want to practice next questions? 2) Do you want to re-answer this question? 3) Or quit 4) listen your last question. Showing options on the screen.
    - Belongs to Textbox Detailed Layout
  
- A plant image and interviewing bot is kind of awkward combination.

  - [x] adding one or some "symbols" (e.g. mustache, hat, documents, ...) to give people perceptions that "this is casual, yet somewhat business-related"
    - Belongs to General Layout
